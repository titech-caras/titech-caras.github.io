Welcome! CARAS is a research group at Tokyo Tech in the Department of Information and Communications Engineering. Our objective is to improve the security, energy-efficiency and dependability of next generation computing devices and systems. We conduct research in all aspects of computer systems, ranging from computer architecture, operating systems to compilers.
